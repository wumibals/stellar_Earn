## Security Architecture

### Access Control

The contract implements a hierarchical role-based access control system:

1. **SuperAdmin**
   - Contract initialization
   - Role management
   - Pause/unpause functionality
   - Contract upgrades

2. **BadgeAdmin**
   - Badge type management
   - Badge assignments

3. **OracleAdmin**
   - Oracle configuration updates
   - Price feed management

4. **StatsAdmin**
   - Batch statistics updates
   - Performance tracking

5. **Pauser**
   - Emergency pause functionality

### Security Mechanisms

1. **Input Validation**
   - Strict type checking
   - Amount boundaries verification
   - Address validation
   - String length limits

2. **Reentrancy Protection**
   - State updates before external calls
   - Atomic operations
   - Cross-contract call safety

3. **State Integrity**
   - Consistent data structure updates
   - Idempotent operations where applicable
   - Atomic batching for related updates

4. **Authorization Checks**
   - Function-level admin checks
   - Role-based permission verification
   - Address authentication

## Audit Focus Areas

### 1. Authorization & Access Control

**Critical Questions:**
- Are all sensitive functions properly protected with role checks?
- Can unauthorized users access or modify restricted data?
- Are role checks performed before state modifications?
- Are there any permission bypass vulnerabilities?

**Review Points:**
- All public functions must verify caller permissions
- Role checks must occur before any state changes
- SuperAdmin role must be properly initialized
- Role grant/revoke operations must be secure

### 2. State Management & Storage

- Is error context sufficient?
- Are error codes distinct?

**Review Points:**
- All error paths are handled
- Error codes are distinct
- Error messages are informative
- Recovery paths are clear

### 10. Concurrency & Race Conditions

**Critical Questions:**

- No TOCTOU vulnerabilities
- Batch operations are atomic

## Contract Invariants

### Fundamental Invariants

1. **Authorization Invariant**
   - Only users with appropriate roles can perform sensitive operations
   - Role membership cannot be forged or spoofed
   - SuperAdmin role is uniquely powerful and must be protected

2. **Fund Conservation Invariant**
   - Total contract funds = sum of all user balances + escrow amounts + reserves
   - Funds cannot be created or destroyed
   - All fund movements must be traced

3. **Reputation Invariant**
   - User reputation changes only through valid quest interactions
   - Reputation cannot be negative (clamped to 0 or 1)
   - Badge assignments are consistent with reputation

4. **Quest State Invariant**
   - Each quest has a valid status (active, completed, cancelled)
   - Active quests must have associated reward pool
   - Completed quests cannot accept new submissions

5. **Submission Workflow Invariant**
   - Submissions follow defined state transitions
   - Only valid submissions can be approved
   - Approved submissions must transfer rewards

6. **Escrow Invariant**
   - Escrowed funds are always held by the contract
   - Release conditions are enforced
   - Escrowed amounts match reserved funds

7. **Oracle Data Invariant**
   - Oracle data is timestamped and versioned
   - Stale data is marked or rejected
   - Multiple sources are required for critical decisions
