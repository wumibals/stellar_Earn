**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** May 30, 2026  
**Purpose:** Structured audit verification checklist for third-party auditors

---

## Pre-Audit Preparation

### Auditor Onboarding

- [ ] Review INVARIANTS.md for critical properties
- [ ] Review THREAT_MODEL.md for known risks
- [ ] Set up local development environment
- [ ] Build contract successfully
- [ ] Run all test suites
- [ ] Verify test coverage reports

### Setup Verification

- [ ] Rust toolchain 1.70+ installed
- [ ] Soroban SDK 21.7.4 verified
- [ ] All dependencies resolve correctly
- [ ] No compilation warnings (except expected)
- [ ] Tests compile and run
- [ ] Environment matches specification

---

## Code Review Checklist

### 1. Authorization & Access Control

#### 1.1 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- [ ] All sensitive functions have role checks
- [ ] Role checks occur BEFORE state modifications
- [ ] SuperAdmin role is properly protected
- [ ] No bypasses around role verification
- [ ] Role verification uses central `require_role()` function
- [ ] All roles are documented
- [ ] Admin functions listed in documentation

**Critical Functions to Verify:**
- [ ] `grant_role()` - only SuperAdmin
- [ ] `revoke_role()` - only SuperAdmin
- [ ] `pause()` - only Pauser/SuperAdmin
- [ ] `create_quest()` - authentication required
- [ ] `approve_submission()` - BadgeAdmin only
- [ ] `update_oracle_config()` - OracleAdmin only

**Test Questions:**
- Attempt operation with wrong role → fails? ✓
- Attempt operation as unauthorized user → fails? ✓
- Grant role, retry operation → succeeds? ✓
- Revoke role, retry operation → fails? ✓

---

#### 1.2 Authentication & Authorization Checks

- [ ] All public functions call `require_auth()` or equivalent
- [ ] Address validation implemented
- [ ] No hardcoded addresses (except known contracts)
- [ ] Caller identity properly verified before state changes
- [ ] Admin checks are centralized
- [ ] No authentication bypass paths

**Verification:**
```rust
// Every function should have one of these patterns:
caller.require_auth();
OR
admin::require_role(&env, &caller, required_role)?;
```

---

#### 1.3 Privilege Escalation

- [ ] Users cannot self-grant admin roles
- [ ] Cannot escalate via cross-contract calls
- [ ] Role hierarchy is enforced
- [ ] No implicit role assumptions
- [ ] Paused contract prevents privilege escalation attempts

**Test Scenarios:**
- [ ] User attempts to grant self SuperAdmin → fails
- [ ] User with BadgeAdmin attempts StatsAdmin operations → fails
- [ ] Revoked admin attempts operations → fails
- [ ] Multiple role changes in sequence work correctly

---

### 2. Fund Safety & Escrow Mechanisms

#### 2.1 Fund Conservation

- [ ] Total funds = user balances + escrow + reserves (always true)
- [ ] Funds cannot be created arbitrarily
- [ ] Funds cannot be destroyed
- [ ] All transfers are tracked
- [ ] No fund loss scenarios identified

**Verification Approach:**
```
Before operation: total_funds = sum(balances) + sum(escrows) + reserves
After operation: total_funds_after matches total_funds
Repeat for all operations
```

---

#### 2.2 Escrow Security

- [ ] Release time is enforced (cannot release early)
- [ ] Only authorized parties can release escrow
- [ ] Escrowed amount matches transferred amount
- [ ] Escrow cannot be double-released
- [ ] Expired escrows can be reclaimed safely

**Critical Scenarios to Verify:**
- [ ] Create escrow, release before time → fails
- [ ] Create escrow, release at/after time → succeeds
- [ ] Create escrow, unauthorized release → fails
- [ ] Create escrow, release twice → fails
- [ ] Transferred amount matches escrow amount

---

#### 2.3 Token Interactions

- [ ] Token transfers are validated
- [ ] Insufficient balance errors are caught
- [ ] Token allowance is managed correctly
- [ ] No token loss in transfers
- [ ] Cross-contract token calls are safe

---

### 3. State Management & Storage

#### 3.1 Storage Consistency

- [ ] Storage operations are atomic

- [ ] Storage initialized before access
- [ ] No uninitialized state reads
- [ ] Indices are valid and contiguous

**Test:**
- [ ] Verify all data structures have required initialization

---

#### 3.2 Data Integrity

- [ ] Data types are properly validated
- [ ] Size limits enforced on arrays/strings
- [ ] Boundaries checked for numbers

- [ ] Referential integrity maintained

**Verification Points:**
- [ ] String length <= MAX_LENGTH

- [ ] Numbers within safe ranges
- [ ] Foreign keys point to valid data

---

#### 3.3 Quest State Machine

- [ ] Quest states follow defined transitions
- [ ] No invalid state transitions occur
- [ ] All state transitions are logged
- [ ] Terminal states are irreversible
- [ ] State consistency after operations

```
Valid Transitions to Verify:
Created → Active → Completed ✓
Created → Cancelled ✓
Active → Cancelled ✓
Active → Completed ✓
Invalid Transitions (must prevent):
Completed → Active ✗
Archived → * ✗
```

---

#### 3.4 Submission Workflow

- [ ] Submissions follow state machine rules
- [ ] Only valid transitions allowed
- [ ] Approvals require authorization
- [ ] Evidence is required for approval
- [ ] Complete audit trail maintained

**State Transition Verification:**
- [ ] Submitted → Evaluating → Approved → Rewarded

- [ ] Rejection is terminal

---

### 4. Math & Precision

- [ ] Division by zero → error

---

#### 4.2 Reputation Calculations

- [ ] Reputation accumulation is correct
- [ ] Reputation decay is consistent
- [ ] Minimum reputation is 0
- [ ] Maximum reputation is enforced
- [ ] Reputation changes are auditable

**Verification:**

- [ ] Median/average calculation correct
- [ ] No single-source dependency

**Scenarios:**
- [ ] Single low outlier, others normal → filtered out
- [ ] Multiple conflicting sources → handled safely

- [ ] State updated before external calls

**Code Pattern:**
```rust
// Correct: Update state first, then external call
update_state(&env, value);
call_external_contract(&env)?;

// Incorrect: External call before state update
call_external_contract(&env)?;
update_state(&env, value);  // Could be re-entered
```

---

#### 6.2 Token Transfer Safety

**Check:**
```rust
// Functions should propagate errors:
result?;
match result {
    Ok(val) => val,
    Err(e) => return Err(e),
}

// NOT silently ignore:
let _ = operation();  // Unless intentional
```

---

#### 8.2 Recovery Paths

- [ ] Graceful degradation where applicable

- [ ] State consistency maintained
- [ ] No race conditions identified

**Example:**
```rust
// Incorrect: Check and update are separate
if check_condition(&env) {
    // Race condition window
    update_state(&env);
}

// Correct: Atomic operation
atomic_check_and_update(&env)?;
```

---
